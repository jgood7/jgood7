<h1>Welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h2>Technical</h2>
My name is Joshua Good and I graduated from UNC Charlotte with a B.S. degree in Computer Science under the AI, Robotics, and Gaming concentration. My coding experience ranges from data mining to neural networks to automation. I have a fascination with information and technology so I am naturally drawn to data and engineering fields. I am confident in my ability to fulfill my role as a software developerk, engineer, or anything handling data such as an analyst.

My personal projects will be housed here in their various repositories. My recent efforts have been broadening my knowledge of API implementations to expand my potential using third-party tools. I have experience in the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Python - 4 years</li>
    <li>Java - 3 years</li>
    <li>Excel VBA - 3 years</li>
    <li>SQL - 2 years</li>
    <li>Javascript - 2 years</li>
    <li>HTML - 2 years</li>
    <li>CSS - 2 years</li>
    <li>Mulesoft - <1 year</li>
    <li>Postman - <1 year</li>
    <li>C# - <1 year</li>
    <li>C++ - <1 year</li>
    <li>C - <1 year</li>
    <li>R - <1 year</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Personal</h2>
Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my Australian Shepherd, Ohana, as well as hiking, skateboarding, and studying foreign languages such as Italian and Russian. I am still undecided on a place to call home so relocation is still an option for me.
